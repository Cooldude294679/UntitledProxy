# How to host?
Currently it is static(Without a bare server) running on my own special bare server!
So it would work if you forked this repo and just did a static host such as, Vercel, github pages, netlify, etc Note: It has to be ON a webserver not local or else it will not work
# Will i have a tutorial on how to make your own bare server soon?
YES!!! This is a work in progress but I have a meathod to host a bare server static and serverless!
